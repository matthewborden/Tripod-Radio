    <h2>The Show</h2>
    <p>Tripod Radio is a series of small radio shows by the students at Trinity Grammar School. To listen to the Podcasts, go to the Radio Tab (below).  <br />
    </p>
    <p>You'll find all sorts of shows here. We have students producing music shows and interviews with teachers -- our own Headmaster is asked a few curly questions in one show! We also have shows debating political issues and current affairs, with interviews with people on the street: a vox pop. Of course, we also have a number of shows where the students are in the studio, telling jokes, making comments on the world, and playing their favorite tracks.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to make a comment on any of these shows, you can follow a link through to the student's own webpage. Here, you'll find another way to download the podcast from the internet. You'll also be able to read their blogs, subscribe to the podcast, and email the students directly.</p>
